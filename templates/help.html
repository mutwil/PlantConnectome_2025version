          We used GPT to evaluate research abstracts and identify pairs of entities (e.g., genes, proteins, molecules, 
          compartments, complexes) in addition to their unique interaction type (e.g., enhances, binds, affects, represses).
          <br> <br>
          For instance, after examining the abstract
          <blockquote>
            "In plants, regulation of cellulose synthesis is fundamental for morphogenesis and plant growth. 
            Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane, and the orientation of synthesis is guided by cortical 
            microtubules; however, the guiding mechanism is currently unknown. We show that the conditional root elongation 
            pom2 mutants are impaired in cell elongation, fertility, and microtubule-related functions. Map-based cloning of 
            the POM-POM2 locus revealed that it is allelic to CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTING1 (CSI1). Fluorescently tagged 
            POM2/CSI1s associated with both plasma membrane-located cellulose synthases (CESAs) and post-Golgi CESA-containing 
            compartments. Interestingly, while CESA insertions coincided with cortical microtubules in the pom2/csi1 mutants, 
            the microtubule-defined movement of the CESAs was significantly reduced in the mutant. We propose that POM2/CSI1 provides 
            a scaffold between the CESAs and cortical microtubules that guide cellulose synthesis."
          </blockquote>
          GPT returned the following statements:

      <div class = "accordion-content" data-tab-content>
        <p>
          You can choose to search for <strong>terms</strong> mentioned in the abstracts/full-texts (for instance, "proline", "cold", "root hair", etc.), <strong>author names</strong>, or <strong>PubMed IDs</strong>.
          <br><br>
          Under <strong>term search</strong>, you can filter the network by node types first by clicking on the checkbox. 
          <br>
          There are also <strong>6 term search options</strong> (word, exact, alias, substring, non-alphanumeric and paired-entity). The detailed search instructions are found on the home page.

                Our KnowledgeNetwork viewer displays a plethora of relationships found between your search query and GPT-detected entities. Should you want to narrow your search options, click on the <strong>"Node Filter Layout Options"</strong> or <strong>"Edge Filter Layout Options"</strong> button:

              As with any AI model, GPT is not 100% accurate, generating results that may be erroneous or incomplete. Accordingly, relationships of interest warrant confirmation with the appropriate abstracts / full-texts. To estimate the accuracy rate, we randomly sampled and manually inspected 300 edges, 100 GRNs and 100 PPIs. The results of which are summarized by the following 2 charts:
            </p>
          </div>
